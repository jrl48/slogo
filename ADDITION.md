#SLogo Addition
Since I worked on frontend, I will change the existing code to fit in an image changing feature from the Turtle view.

#### Estimation
I'd wager it would take from 45 min. to an hour to complete this, and would take about 3 classes. 
The features that are propositioned exist in part already, and the code is fully extendable and reusable, so I see no hardships in doing this.

#### Review
The excercise took half an hour, and needed to update one class. We already had a TableView to see the Turtles implemented for convenience, and a Preference pane that could let us change the image. Since the code was well written, and was extension-ready, I had no problems in shifting the preference pane's functionalities onto the Turtle Table. It was done in the first try.

#### Analysis
Given the amazing ease I had while doing this exercise, I'd say that the design and documentation for SLogo is superb. 
I had no worries finding anything in the code, and every single class and method were very well documented.
Truthfully, it's better than I remembered. I'm quite sure there is still space for improvement, but the small parts of the code that I read through are great the way they are.
The project would probably take about the same time I did, if someone had already some prior knowledge of Frontend design. If not, I'd say it would take double that.
